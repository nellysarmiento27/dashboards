R shinny dashboards

This dashboard is helpful to have a first preview of the data set we are going to work with. It shows several plots to understand where outliers, known distribution or trends could be.
It is necessary to open the file with RStudio and have in the same folder the data set and the R script, otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
